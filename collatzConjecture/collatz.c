/**
 * collatz.c
 * 
 * Created by Garet Robertson.
 * Last updated on 2016 June 27.
 * 
 * This little program is designed to test Collatz Conjecture (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) for any given integer.
 * The hotpo (an initialism of "half or triple plus one") function recursively checks the value of the integer, keeping track of how it changes it using printf().
 * If it is even, then it divides it by two.
 * If it is odd, then it multiplies it by three, then adds one.
 * Unless it is one, in which case its job is done and it returns.
 * The Collatz conjecture states that performing this operation continuously will always lead to the number one.
 * (When the operations are performed on the number one, it simply loops back to itself.)
