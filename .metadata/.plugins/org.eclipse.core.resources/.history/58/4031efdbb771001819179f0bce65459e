# STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
# A while ago I tried to build a calculator in Java that took a String
# expression and evaluated it. I wanted it to correctly handle parentheses and
# order of operations. This was hard enough that I never really got it working.
# I decided that Python was probably an easier language to use to create little
# apps that I did not expect anyone but myself to use. So I started creating
# the same thing in Python using more or less the same strategy. Then I found
# out that Python, as usual, has a method that essentially does this all for
# you. It's called eval() and it's available everywhere.
# But I don't want it to just be a command-line thing. I want to replace the
# Windows calculator. So I found a third party graphics module (apparently
# there is no built in one) that seems quite common and have started to build
# the app.
# TODO:
# Let numbers be entered as days, hours, minutes, etc. Convert everything to
# seconds, perform calculations, then express in largest units and also smaller
# units if necessary.
# Make a factorize or unmultiply function.
# Make LCD and GCD functions.
# Add tau as a constant (if math doesn't already define it).
# Add a changeBase() function that lets one change the base of a number to
# enter / get numbers e.g. in base 12.
# Let the text driver accept variable assignments, e.g.
# ==> x = 6
# ==> x + 7
# 13
# Make the text driver continuously prompt for more input until told to quit
# (so one can perform multiple calculates in one run).
# Consider replacing the || / abs() switch in calc with a regex solution. (This
# seems like it would proabably be simpler.)
# Make it possible to type in functions (e.g. cos) without parentheses when
# they only have one simple, literal argument (e.g. cos2). I think it might be
# possible to loop through looking (with a regex) for a word followed
# immediately by a number, then surround the number with parentheses.
# Once you get most of the other things working, I would like to be able to map
# keys on my keyboard to different things so that I do not have to use all of
# keys around the edge to type in a mathematical expression. (I don't know if
# there would be a good way to do this, though.)
# Create a generic log function that takes a base variable.
